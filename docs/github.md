GitHub was used as the central platform for version control and collaboration throughout the development of GeoBingo. The project was developed entirely within the main branch, which was considered sufficient given the small team size and the incremental nature of the sprint-based workflow. All updates, features, and fixes were committed directly to main, ensuring that the repository always reflected the most recent stable version of the game.

The repository is structured into clear folders—such as my_package/ for the application code, tests/ for the unit tests, data/ for the capitals dataset, docker/ for deployment files, and docs/ for documentation, to keep the project organized as it evolved. Commit messages were used to track progress aligned with sprint tasks, document changes, and maintain a traceable history of implementation decisions. Even without using feature branches, GitHub provided transparency over contributions and allowed the team to manage updates in a structured and consistent way.

This setup ensured that every sprint increment was preserved, all artifacts were easily accessible, and the final deployment and documentation could be traced back through the commit history.
