**GeoBingo – Game Instructions**

Welcome to GeoBingo, a geography-based Bingo game where your knowledge of world capitals helps you complete your Bingo card.
Your goal is simple: mark every number on your card to get BINGO!

**How the Game Works**
- You start with a 3×7 Bingo card filled with random numbers.
- In each round, the game shows you a country, and you must guess its capital.

If your answer is correct:

- A random number is drawn.
- If that number is on your card, it gets marked in green.

If your answer is wrong, you lose one attempt.

- You win if you mark the entire card before running out of attempts.

**You can type:**

h → Show instructions again

q → Quit the game at any time

**Difficulty Levels**

Before the game starts, you must choose between three difficulties, each changing how the game is played:

1. Easy Mode
   - Format: Multiple-choice (4 options)
   - Cards: Numbers from 1 to 50
   - Attempts: 7 attempts
   - Best for learning or warming up
   - Capitals come from the full dataset, but answering is easier thanks to the options.

2. Medium Mode (Default)
   - Format: Open-answer (type the capital yourself)
   - Cards: Numbers from 1 to 70
   - Attempts: 5 attempts
   - Similar to a classic quiz: type your answer freely.

3. Hard Mode
   - Format: Open-answer with timer
   - You have 6 seconds to answer.
   - Cards: Numbers from 1 to 99
   - Attempts: 4 attempts
   - Designed for quick thinking and advanced players.
   - If you don’t type fast enough, the answer is automatically marked as incorrect.

**No Repeated Questions**

The game has a system that ensures:
- You never get the same country twice until all others have been used.
- When all countries are used, the game automatically reshuffles and continues.

**Winning the Game**

You win when:
All numbers on your Bingo card are marked
→ The game displays a BINGO! message.

You lose when:
- Your attempts reach zero before completing the card.
