GeoBingo – Game Instructions

Welcome to GeoBingo, a geography-based Bingo game where your knowledge of world capitals helps you complete your Bingo card.
Your goal is simple: mark every number on your card to get BINGO!

🎮 How the Game Works

You start with a 3×7 Bingo card filled with random numbers.

In each round, the game shows you a country, and you must guess its capital.

If your answer is correct:

A random number is drawn.

If that number is on your card, it gets marked in green.

If your answer is wrong, you lose one attempt.

You win if you mark the entire card before running out of attempts.

You can type:

h → Show instructions again

q → Quit the game at any time

🎚️ Difficulty Levels

Before the game starts, you must choose between three difficulties, each changing how the game is played:

1️⃣ Easy Mode

Format: Multiple-choice (4 options)

Cards: Numbers from 1 to 50

Attempts: 7 attempts

Best for learning or warming up.

Capitals come from the full dataset, but answering is easier thanks to the options.

2️⃣ Medium Mode (Default)

Format: Open-answer (type the capital yourself)

Cards: Numbers from 1 to 70

Attempts: 5 attempts

Similar to a classic quiz: type your answer freely.

Format: Open-answer with timer

You have 6 seconds to answer.

Cards: Numbers from 1 to 99

Attempts: 4 attempts

Designed for quick thinking and advanced players.

If you don’t type fast enough, the answer is automatically marked as incorrect.

🔁 No Repeated Questions

The game has a system that ensures:

You never get the same country twice until all others have been used.

When all countries are used, the game automatically reshuffles and continues.

🎯 Winning the Game

All numbers on your Bingo card are marked
→ The game displays a BINGO! message.

You lose when:

Your attempts reach zero before completing the card.
