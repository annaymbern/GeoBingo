Sprint Goal:

Develop the full interactive game logic, question system, attempt limits, and Bingo detection.

Sprint Duration: 2 weeks

Selected Product Backlog Items:
1. Implement question system (country → capital).

4. Detect numbers in card and mark them when found.


5. Implement attempt limit (lose after 3 incorrect answers).

Plan for Delivery:
- Question Engine: Randomly select countries and compare user input to correct capitals.


- Turn System: Alternate between two players; show the active player’s name.


- Game Logic: Draw random Bingo numbers; if correct, mark them on that player’s card only.


- Win/Loss Detection: End the game when a player completes their card or uses all attempts.


- UI Feedback: Clear turn display, messages for correct/incorrect answers, and simple visuals.


Definition of Done:
Game playable in the terminal with two players, alternating turns, and clear win/loss feedback.
