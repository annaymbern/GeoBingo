PRODUCT BACKLOG - VERSION 1:
1. A simple csv file with world countries and capitals.
2. Load the csv file into a dataframe.
3. A 7x3 Bingo grid generator with random numbers (no blank spaces).
4. Tests to make sure we did the greed and the uploaded de csv file correctly.

In the first version of the backlog, we focused on building the technical foundations of the project. This included creating the CSV file with countries and capitals, loading it into a DataFrame, generating the 7x3 Bingo grid, and running basic validation tests.
At this stage, the main goal was to ensure the game’s data and core structure worked properly, without yet addressing the user interface, difficulty levels, or additional features, hence we decided to add this to the product backlog



PRODUCT BACKLOG - VERSION 2:
1. A simple csv file with world countries and capitals.
2. Load the csv file into a dataframe.
3. A 7x3 Bingo grid generator with random numbers (no blank spaces).
4. Tests to make sure we did the greed and the uploaded de csv file correctly.
5. Load dataframe
6. Unit tests for data
7. Create Gitignore
8. Create attempts
9. Create different levels
10. Implement draw_capitals test

   


PRODUCT BACKLOG - FINAL VERSION: 
1. Create CSV file with countries and capitals
2. Load CSV data into a pandas DataFrame.
3. Generate bingo cards (7x3 grid)
4. Implement unit tests for data and grid validation.
5. Begin version control setup (GitHub repository, .gitignore…).
6. Improve project structure (folders, __init__.py, and requirements.txt).
7. Implement a basic user interface in the terminal.
8. Integrate DataFrame reading and number display logic.
9. Create attempts (5).
10. Exit conditions (q).
11. Detect numbers in card and mark them when found.
12. Add win condition detection (full Bingo)
14. Testing and debugging
15. Avoid repeating Capitals
16. Make more visual the crossing of the number in the bingo card.
17. Create different levels of difficulty
18. Display instructions of game
