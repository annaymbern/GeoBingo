Sprint Goal:

Refine the project structure and ensure smooth integration of the data and card system.

Sprint Duration: 2 weeks

Selected Product Backlog Items:

1. Improve project structure (folders, __init__.py, and requirements.txt).


2. Implement a basic user interface in the terminal.


3. Integrate DataFrame reading and number display logic.


4. Begin version control setup (GitHub repository, .gitignore).


Plan for Delivery:
- Organize repository folders (data/, my_package/, tests/).


- Implement the main script (main.py) to load the DataFrame and generate the card.


- Create a simple text-based interface to display the board and handle basic input.


- Push all progress to GitHub and ensure it runs via python my_package/main.py.


Definition of Done:
- Game runs from the terminal, loads data correctly, and generates readable cards.
