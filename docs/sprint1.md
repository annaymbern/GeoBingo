SPRINT 1:

SPRINT PLANNING 

Sprint Goal Definition (Sprint - 1 week)
1. What can we realistically deliver in this sprint?
We can deliver the foundations of the project, including:
A simple csv file with world countries and capitals.
Load the csv file into a dataframe.
A 7x3 Bingo grid generator with random numbers (no blank spaces).
Tests to make sure we did the greed and the uploaded de csv file correctly.
2. Which features/tasks bring the most value now?
Clean structure: It ensures the code is maintainable and aligned with best practices.
Dataframe with capitals: Provides the educational content core to the game.
Grid generation: First tangible game element, shows progress and gives players a basic board.
3. How will we measure sprint success?
The project can be executed without errors in test.
The Bingo grid (7x3) is generated and displayed correctly.
The dataframe with capitals is available and can be accessed by the program.
Sprint Backlog (tasks + owners)

Create a csv file with countries and their capitals and implement dataframe. 

Search capital data: Find an updated list of all world capitals (from a reliable online source)
Translate and clean data: Ensure capital names are in English and remove inconsistencies (accents, duplicates, formatting issues).
Format dataset: Store capitals in a structured format (CSV), with two columns like Country, Capital.
Load dataframe: Write Python code to load the dataset into a dataframe (using pandas).
Unit tests for data: Write unit tests to check: (1) dataset loads correctly, (2) all rows are valid, (3) no duplicates


Create bingo card .

Define grid data structure : Decide how the grid will be stored in code (list of lists).
Implement grid generator: Write a function that generates a 7 (columns) x 3 (rows) Bingo card with random numbers within a defined range (1–99).
Validate uniqueness: Add checks to ensure numbers don’t repeat inside the grid and that all cells are filled (no blanks).
Print grid neatly: Make sure it displays the grid aligned in rows/columns in the terminal. Ensure readability for children. Clear lines for separating the numbers in the bingo card. Numbers in a visible colour.
Unit tests for grid: Write tests to confirm: (1) grid is 7x3, (2) numbers are unique, (3) all cells filled.
Documentation: Write a short guide in /docs explaining: how the grid is generated, how colors work, and how to modify rules if needed.

*all these tasks will be all conducted by the developers. 

DAILY SPRINT
